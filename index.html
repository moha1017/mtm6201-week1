        <p> My name is Omar Mohamed Ahmed, and I am 18 years old. I am now a student at Algonquin College, and this will be my fourth year in Canada. I am looking forward to my journey through college. I am a person who enjoys being out in nature and spending time outdoors. I like to capture moments that I find beautiful. I also enjoy listening to music because I truly believe that music can almost heal anything to a certain extent. I am a very curious person by nature, and I enjoy learning about new things every day, whether they are small or large.
